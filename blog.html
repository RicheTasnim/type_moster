                <h3 class="text-success">1. Difference between localStorage and sessionStorage :</h3>
                <p class="m-4">SessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session gets created and assigned to that particular tab.</p>

                <h3 class="text-success">2. Difference between global scope and block scope :</h3>
                <p class="m-4 ">In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js, it's controlled by the global object.
                A block is a piece of code inside a set of curly braces {} and groups code statements together. An example of a block could be a function, like this: The Global scope. A variable exists inside or outside a block. If a variable is declared outside all functions or curly braces ({}), it exists in the global scope. </p>

                <h3 class="text-success">3. How does work event loop in javascript??</h3>
                <p class="m-4">The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

                <h3 class="text-success ">4. Why do we get undefined??</h3>
                <p class="m-4">A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.</p>
